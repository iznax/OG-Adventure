# OG-Adventure
Old school adventure game with items and castles
Not an exact remake of the 80's just an experiment to help appreciate how great the original game was for the time.

Winners bring the shining Chalice to the Yellow Castle, slay some harmless dragons or unravel the mysterious black dot.
